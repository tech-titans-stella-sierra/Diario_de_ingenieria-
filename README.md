Autonomous Cart Project: Description and Development Process
The autonomous cart we are developing is a system designed to detect and avoid objects based on their color. This project involves several components integrated with an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which coordinates the operation of each part of the system. Below are the main components and their functions, their relationship with the vehicle's electromechanical components, and the process for building, compiling, and uploading code to the vehicle's controllers.

Components and Their Functions
H-Bridge L298N:
Function: Controls the cart's DC motor, allowing variable speed to avoid obstacles.
Operation: Acts as a bidirectional switch that can change the polarity of the electric current sent to the motor, enabling the motor to spin in both directions. This is crucial for moving the cart forward and backward, as well as performing precise evasive maneuvers.
MG996R Servo Motor:

Function: Controls the direction of the cart's front wheels.
Operation: By using specific angles, the servo motor can direct the wheels to the right, left, or maintain them in a central position, facilitating the cart's change of direction. It is known for its high precision and torque capability, ideal for steering control in small vehicles. The servo motor is controlled by PWM (pulse-width modulation) signals generated by the Arduino.
Ultrasonic Sensors:

Function: Detect the presence of objects in the cart's path.
Operation: Emit high-frequency sound waves and measure the time it takes to receive the echo after it reflects off an object. Based on this time, the sensor can calculate the distance to the object. When an object is detected, the system is programmed to stop the cart and analyze the situation, ensuring it can safely maneuver around the obstacle.
GY-31 Color Sensor:

Function: Allows the cart to avoid objects based on their color.
Operation: Identifies the color of obstacles using an RGB LED and a photodiode that measures the intensity of light reflected at different wavelengths. This allows the cart to make informed decisions about which side to pass to effectively avoid the obstacle.
Relationship with the Vehicle's Electromechanical Components
The H-Bridge L298N, MG996R servo motor, ultrasonic sensors, and GY-31 color sensor work together to provide the cart with advanced navigation and obstacle detection capabilities. The interaction between these electromechanical and electronic components is coordinated by the Arduino Uno, which acts as the brain of the system.

The H-Bridge and DC motor are directly connected to the cart's rear wheels, providing the necessary propulsion.
The MG996R servo motor is connected to the front wheels and controls the cart's direction.
The ultrasonic sensors are strategically positioned at the front and sides of the cart to provide 360-degree detection coverage.
The GY-31 color sensor is mounted in a position that allows it to scan obstacles in the cart's path.
Building, Compiling, and Uploading Code Process
Circuit Design:

Start with designing the electrical circuit, ensuring that all components are correctly connected to the Arduino Uno. This includes connecting the H-Bridge to the Arduino control pins, the servo motor to a PWM pin, and the ultrasonic and color sensors to the appropriate digital and analog pins.
Writing the Code:

The next step is to write the code in the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The code should include the necessary libraries to control each component, as well as functions to read sensor data, process this information, and send commands to the actuators (H-Bridge and servo motor). It should also implement the navigation algorithm that allows the cart to detect and avoid objects based on their color.
Compilation:

Once the code is written, it is compiled in the Arduino IDE to check for syntax or compilation errors. Compilation converts the source code into a binary file that can be uploaded to the microcontroller.
Code Upload:

After a successful compilation, the binary code is uploaded to the Arduino Uno via a USB cable. The Arduino IDE includes tools for uploading the code and monitoring the microcontroller's output in real-time.
Testing and Adjustment:

With the code uploaded to the Arduino, testing is conducted to ensure all components function correctly. This may include testing the cart's movement, obstacle detection, and response to different object colors. If issues are found, adjustments are made to the code or circuit design.
Conclusion
The design of our autonomous cart combines various technologies and electromechanical components to create a system capable of navigating safely and efficiently, avoiding obstacles based on their color. The integration of an H-Bridge, a servo motor, ultrasonic sensors, and a color sensor, all controlled by an Arduino Uno, enables complex and precise interaction between software and hardware. The process of building, compiling, and uploading code to the controllers is essential for ensuring the correct operation of the system and is carefully executed to ensure all parts work in harmony.
